'''Encoding and Decoding Base64 Strings in Python
The Base64 encoding is used to convert bytes that have binary or text data into ASCII characters. Encoding prevents the data from getting corrupted when it is transferred or processed through a text-only system. In this article, we will discuss about Base64 encoding and decoding and its uses to encode and decode binary and text data.
Base64 encoding:
It is a type of conversion of bytes to ASCII characters. the list of available Base64 characters are mentioned below:
26 uppercase letters
26 lowercase letters
10 numbers
+ and / for new lines
Each Base64 character represents 6 bits of data. it is also important to note that it is not meant for encryption for obvious reasons.
To convert a string into a Base64 character the following steps should be followed:

Get the ASCII value of each character in the string.
Compute the 8-bit binary equivalent of the ASCII values
Convert the 8-bit characters chunk into chunks of 6 bits by re-grouping the digits
Convert the 6-bit binary groups to their respective decimal values.
Use the Base64 encoding table to align the respective Base64 values for each decimal value.

#Another common encoding scheme is Base64, which allows us to represent binary data as an ASCII string using 64 characters. One character of a Base64 string encodes 6 bits, and so 4 characters of Base64 encodes three 8-bit bytes.

#Base64 is most commonly used online, where binary data such as images can be easy included into html or css files.

#1 form of converting to base64
'''passw = "i_lv_coding"
  
# converting password to base64 encoding  
passw = passw.encode('base64', 'strict') '''
#passw.decode('base64', 'strict')

'''Using python to encode strings:
In Python the base64 module is used to encode and decode data. First, the strings are converted into byte-like objects and then encoded using the base64 module. The below example shows the implementation of encoding strings isnâ€™t base64 characters.'''

'''import base64 
  
sample_string = "GeeksForGeeks is the best"
sample_string_bytes = sample_string.encode("ascii") 
  
base64_bytes = base64.b64encode(sample_string_bytes) 
base64_string = base64_bytes.decode("ascii") 
  
print(f"Encoded string: {base64_string}") '''

#Encoded string: R2Vla3NGb3JHZWVrcyBpcyB0aGUgYmVzdA==

'''Using Python to decode strings:
Decoding Base64 string is exactly opposite to that of encoding. First we convert the Base64 strings into unencoded data bytes followed by conversion into bytes-like object into a string. The below example depicts the decoding of the above example encode string output.'''


'''import base64

base64_bytes = base64_string.encode("ascii") 
  
sample_string_bytes = base64.b64decode(base64_bytes) 
sample_string = sample_string_bytes.decode("ascii") 
  
print(f"Decoded string: {sample_string}") '''

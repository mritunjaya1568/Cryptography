Lets check the file info of the certificate

file 2048b-rsa-example-cert.der


Cool! openssl for the win lets check out various options

openssl x509 -inform der -in 2048b-rsa-example-cert.der

Note: -inform der is used to specify that format of input file is .der


MEH! humans dont understand base64! Lets try the -text flag

openssl x509 -inform der -in 2048b-rsa-example-cert.der -text

But seriously this base64 thingy is killing me! Lets use -noout flag

Now we talking! -modulus flag ouputs modulus separately since we need it specifically a lot of places

and now we have nice hex modulus!

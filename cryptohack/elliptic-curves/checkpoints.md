# Another concern for ECC-systems is the danger of fault attacks, especially when running on smart cards (see, for example, Biehl et al.[21]). 

# Several classes of curves are weak and should be avoided:

    curves over {\displaystyle \mathbb {F} _{2^{m}}} with non-prime {\displaystyle m} are vulnerable to Weil descent attacks.[7][8]
    curves such that {\displaystyle n} divides {\displaystyle p^{B}-1} (where {\displaystyle p} is the characteristic of the field â€“ {\displaystyle q} for a prime field, or {\displaystyle 2} for a binary field) for sufficiently small {\displaystyle B} are vulnerable to MOV attack[9][10] which applies usual DLP in a small degree extension field of {\displaystyle \mathbb {F} _{p}} to solve ECDLP. The bound {\displaystyle B} should be chosen so that discrete logarithms in the field {\displaystyle \mathbb {F} _{p^{B}}} are at least as difficult to compute as discrete logs on the elliptic curve {\displaystyle E(\mathbb {F} _{q})}.[11]
    curves such that {\displaystyle |E(\mathbb {F} _{q})|=q} are vulnerable to the attack that maps the points on the curve to the additive group of {\displaystyle \mathbb {F} _{q}}[12][13][14]

# Because not all points are generators, however, only the generator point can generate all the points on the curve.

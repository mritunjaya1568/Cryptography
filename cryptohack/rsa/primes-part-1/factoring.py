#1st method- you can use factordb.com-a site storing a large databases of factors
#2nd method-https://alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM - another website that uses Elliptic Curve Method (ECM) and the Self-Initializing Quadratic Sieve (SIQS) for factoring no. 
#3rd method-you can also use https://www.wolframalpha.com/ for finding factors
#4th method -primefac a cli tool -https://pypi.org/project/primefac/
# (but it uses original python so it cant be run with python3 and my system only supports python3)
# !/bin/sh
# thanks for updating the project elliptical-shiho
# https://github.com/elliptic-shiho/primefac-fork
 
 # python -m primefac -v 510143758735509025530880200653196460532653147

# print(factorint(510143758735509025530880200653196460532653147))
